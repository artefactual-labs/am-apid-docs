# API documentaion project

Currently, information about APIs is sprinkled throughout Archivematica's documentation library. Our developers, clients, and community have expressed the need for a single, clear, access point to understand the capabilities of the Archivematica API and Storage Service API. With potential overlap between the two mechanisms, this might be a single resource that describes both. This may also improve visibility of the APIs capabilities to the community and potentially increase its usage. This would bring with it other advantages such as making Archivematica a "household" name, so to speak.


## Purpose

To provide users with a single, clear, access point in the documentation library to understand the capabilities of all APIs that we expose and support in our product(s).


### Objectoves

* Improve the accessibility and retrieval of API information for Archivematica and the Storage Service.

* Integrate API-related information from the Development Wiki with the Documentation Library @ www.archivematica.org .

* Slice, dice, and/or consolidate help topics identified in [am-docs issue #81](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica-docs/issues/81).
